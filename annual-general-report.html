                <p>Designed and output an annual general report proposal for a
                publicly listed company of my choice. I had to state the
                purpose of of my annual general report, who the target audience
                is and what message I wished to convey. I had to have at least
                12 pages. Page numbering and the use of master pages were
                required. The annual general report to be designed needed to
                include the following: front and back cover, a contents
                page/spread, at least 4 text oriented pages, at least 2 graphic
                oriented pages and at least 1 financial double page spread that
                includes at least 1 table and 3 graphs. The annual general
                report had to be full colour process(CMYK). The final size of
                my annual general report was my choice. I had to use imagery,
                typography, colour and supporting design elements that would
                help convey the message and appeal to my chosen target
                audience. All content in my annual general report had to be
                morally and ethically ecceptable.</p>
