                <p>Designed and output a full colour, 8 page typographic
                magazine. The trim size had to be A4. Document had to be set up
                to the specifications provided. This was the first edition of a
                new magazine. I had to decide on a name and an appropriate
                nameplate for the front cover. Text and images were provided. I
                had to decide on the purpose of the magazine, who the target
                audience was and what message I wished to convey. I needed to
                use imagery, typography and supporting design elements that
                would help convey the message in my magazine and appeal to my
                chosen target audience. The magazine was to be full colour CMYK
                only. I had to use all the text supplied and choose suitable
                images to accompany the text from those supplied. I had to set
                up and use paragraph styles for all of the text and use
                character styles where appropriate. I had to also use master
                pages and automatic page numbering.</p>
