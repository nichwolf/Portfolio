                <p>I had to design and output a range of campaign items for a
                company, product or service of my choice. I was allowed to
                redesign a logo or use an existing one. The items being
                produced were predominantly for print, although I could have
                included one item for screen if I wished. ie: web site
                template, animation, movie etc. At least one of the printed
                items needed to be a non-2-dimensional promotional item ie:
                flip book, pop up, pop out, packaging etc. All other items were
                up to me to choose to best suit the needs of the company
                product or service that I had chosen. I had to use imagery,
                typography, colour and supporting design elements that would
                help convey the message throughout my campaign and appeal to my
                target audience. I had to present a "template style" mood board
                that represented the the style/theme to show the visual
                direction of my campaign. ie: colours, typefaces, supporting
                design elements, imagery and inspiration. This had to presented
                to the class before commencing production. During my
                presentation I had to give a "rational" as to why I think my
                style would appeal to the target audience. All content in the
                campaign had to be morally and ethically ecceptable.</p>
