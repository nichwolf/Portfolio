                <p>Designed and output a new contemporary magazine and created
                a name for it. It needed to have at least 12 pages. It needed
                to include a contents page or spread. It needed to include a
                half page advert designed by me. The magazine had to be full
                colour process (CMYK). The front cover had to include an
                additional special ink. The final size of the magazine was my
                choice. Page numbering and the use of master pages were
                required. There needed to be at least 5 articles to demonstrate
                the correct use of paragraph styles and character styles where
                necessary. I needed to use imagery, typography, colour and
                supporting design elements that would help convey the message
                and appeal to my chosen target audience.</p>
