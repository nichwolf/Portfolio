                <p>Designed and output a two sided multifold brochure. The trim
                size had to be no larger than A3. The client for the brochure
                was a new local art school. I was free to decide what the
                purpose of the brochure would be, who the target audience was
                and what message I wished to convey. I was required to name the
                company and design a logo for it. I needed to use imagery,
                typography, colour and supporting design elements that would
                help convey the message in the brochure and appeal to my chosen
                target audience. It needed to be a 2 Pantone spot colour
                brochure. The final folded size of the brochure was my choice
                but it had to use a minimum of 2 folds and it needed to include
                a diecut.</p>
