                <h1>About me</h1>
                <p>I’m currently working as a Digital Content Manager for Retail Links Ltd where my responsibilities are to manage the content of all brand websites and E-commerce platforms. Administer changes and improvements to all websites and E-commerce platforms front end and admin back-end. Produce video and photographic content, including editing and publishing and to create attractive and effective collateral for each brand.</p>
                
                <p>Prior to what I’m doing now I was working as a Digital Marketing Assistant for Retail Links Ltd where my responsibilities were to support the senior graphic designer working across both print and web platforms, taking ownership of updating the national websites — 4seasons.co.nz, broilking.co.nz, jayline.co.nz, galaxyspas.co.nz, bosca.co.nz, retaillinks.co.nz, fisherstoves.co.nz and spasensationz.co.nz with content and products, taking video & photographs of products — clear cutting and optimizing for web, working within branding guidelines creating web banners and sales tickets for all 4 Seasons national stores.</p>

<p>I’m a qualified Graphic Designer with experience in both print and web doing a combination of in-house, agency and freelance design work.</p> 

<p>I’ve worked on the advertising and marketing material for the brands Philips, Thule, Case Logic, Maxview, OMP Global Style, Pudney, Belmont, Vac-Pac, Jayline, 4Seasons, Galaxy Spas, Garden Art, Bosca, Fisher Traditional and Broil King. I've done work for the clients Tekron International, Photo Higher, Scratch. Good Honest Food and In Our Village.</p>

<p>I am proficient in graphic design, responsive web design, user experience design, digital pre-press for print, digital photography — product photography and food photography, image manipulation, DSLR video production and editing, using the Adobe Creative Cloud platforms Indesign, Illustrator, Photoshop, Premiere Pro, XD, using web languages HTML and CSS and using web platforms WooCommerce, Shopify, WordPress, Drupal and SilverStripe. I am also consistently upskilling in front-end web development, user experience design, E-commerce and digital marketing.</p>

<p>I am a quiet, focused worker so my strengths lie more in thought orientated, technical jobs. I have a very methodical approach to my work, with a keen eye for detail. I work well within a team and under pressure. I do not mind turning my hand to new tasks and learning new skills to fit in where I am needed.</p>
