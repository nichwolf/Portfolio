                <h1>About me</h1>
                <p>I’m currently working as a digital marketing assistant where my responsibilities are to support the senior designer working across both print and web platforms, taking ownership of updating the  national websites — 4seasons.co.nz, broilking.co.nz, Jayline.co.nz, galaxyspas.co.nz, bosca.co.nz,  retaillinks.co.nz, fisherstoves.co.nz and spasensationz.co.nz with content and products,  taking video & photographs  of products — clear cutting and optimizing for web, working within branding guidelines creating web banners  and sales tickets for all 4 Seasons national stores.</p>

<p>I’m a qualified Graphic Designer with six  years experience doing a combination of  in-house, agency and freelance graphic design work.</p> 

<p>I’ve worked on the advertising and marketing material for the brands Philips, Thule, Case Logic, Maxview, OMP Global Style, Pudney, Belmont, Vac-Pac, Jayline, 4Seasons, Galaxy Spas, Garden Art, Bosca, Fisher Traditional and Broil King.  I've done work for the clients Tekron International, Photo Higher, Scratch. Good Honest Food and In Our Village.</p>

<p>I’ve designed logos, brochures, flyers, portfolios, catalogues, business cards, posters, instore signage, instore displays, product packaging and magazine adverts, which included preparing graphics for the web, image manipulation, product photography, food photography and food presentation.</p>

<p>I am proficient in Indesign, Illustrator, Photoshop, Premiere Pro,  digital pre-press for print, digital photography, DSLR video production and editing , HTML, CSS, WooCommerce, Responsive Web Design, WordPress, Drupal, SilverStripe and I am upskilling in digital marketing and  front-end web development.</p>

<p>I am a quiet, focused worker so my strengths lie more in thought orientated, technical jobs. I have a very methodical approach to my work, with a keen eye for detail. I work well within a team and under pressure. I do not mind turning my hand to new tasks and learning new skills to fit in where I am needed. </p>
